# ToDo List Project - Marcela Britos
## ADA ITW - FrontEnd

### Final Project - Module 5

My name is Marcela Britos, I am a student of FrontEnd Development at ADA ITW and this is my Final Project of Module 5.

## ðŸ“‘ Project description

This website has been developed with knowledge of HTML5, JavaScript and React concepts. In addition, I have used Tailwind CSS, a framework that allows agile development, based on utility classes that can be easily applied in the code.


This site allows you to add your tasks so you can have control over them, being able to mark them as complete or incomplete, it also has a filter so you can have the best experience when doing your tasks, I hope you enjoy it! 

This project was made with the Github service, and you can see it through this [link](https://to-do-app-eight-umber.vercel.app/)
